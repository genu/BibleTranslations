### Project Description
This is an effort to create bible translations in languages where there is currently no effort in creating a translation in said language.

### Process
1. Languages are proposed simply by creating a folder for it in the root of the repository
2. Translations should begin with the New Testament, since its shorter, and can be used individually while the Old Testament is being completed.
3. If adding a new translation, duplicate the `temmplate` folder, rename it from `template` to the language name, and update the `info.md` describing the translation, and contribution information
4. 4. Given the nature of the task, once a translation is considered complete, it will need to go through a review/editing process

### File Organization
## Structure
The best way in organizing files, is to have each book in a separate folder. For example:
- New Testament
    - Matthew
         - 1.md
         - 2.md
         - ...etc
